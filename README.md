Exercise Instructions
--------------------------
6-1
--
A. Write an application that counts by five from 5 through 500 inclusive, and that starts a new line after every multiple of 50 (50, 100, 150, and so on). Save the file as CountByFives.java.

B. Modify the CountByFives application so that the user enters the value to count by. Start each new line after 10 values have been displayed. Save the file as CountByAnything.java.

6-2
--
Write an application that asks a user to type an even number or the sentinel value 999 to stop. When the user types an even number, display the message “Good job!” and then ask for another input. When the user types an odd number, display an error message and then ask for another input. When the user types the sentinel value 999, end the program. Save the file as EvenEntryLoop.java.

6-3
--
Write an application that displays the factorial for every integer value from 1 to 10. A factorial of a number is the product of that number multiplied by each positive integer lower than it. For example, 4 factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 24. Save the file as Factorials.java.

6-4
--
Write an application that prompts a user for two integers and displays every integer between them. Display a message if there are no integers between the entered values. Make sure the program works regardless of which entered value is larger. Save the file as Inbetween.java

6-5
--
Write an application that displays every perfect number from 1 through 1,000. A perfect number is one that equals the sum of all the numbers that divide evenly into it. For example, 6 is perfect because 1, 2, and 3 divide evenly into it, and their sum is 6; however, 12 is not a perfect number because 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 divide evenly into it, and their sum is greater than 12. Save the file as Perfect.java.

6-6
--
Write an application that uses a loop to create the pattern of Os shown in Figure 6-32, in which each O is displayed one additional space to the right. Save the file as DiagonalOs.java.

6-7
--
In Chapter 1 you created a program named Triangle in which you displayed a seven-line triangle pattern like the one in Figure 6-33 by using a series of println() statements. Now, using your knowledge of loops, revise the program so that it contains no more than three output statements. Save the file as TriangleWithLoops.java.

6-8
--
Write an application that allows a user to enter any number of student quiz scores until the user enters 99. If the score entered is less than 0 or more than 10, display an appropriate message and do not use the score. After all the scores have been entered, display the number of scores entered, the highest score, the lowest score, and the arithmetic average. Save the file as QuizScoreStatistics.java.

6-9
--
The Freemont Automobile Factory has discovered that the longer a worker has been on the job, the more parts the worker can produce. Write an application that computes and displays a worker’s anticipated output each month for 24 months assuming the worker starts by producing 4,000 parts and increases production by 6 percent each month. Also display the month in which production exceeds 7,000 parts (when the worker deserves a raise!). Save the file as IncreasedProduction.java.

6-10
--
A. Write an application that prompts a user for the number of years the user has until retirement and the amount of money the user can save annually. If the user enters 0 or a negative number for either value, reprompt the user until valid entries are made. Assume that no interest is earned on the money. Display the amount of money the user will have at retirement. Save the file as RetirementGoal.java.

B. Modify the RetirementGoal application to display the amount of money the user will have if the user earns 4% interest on the balance every year. Save the file as RetirementGoal2.java.

6-12
--
Assume that the population of Mexico is 128 million and that the population increases 1.01 percent annually. Assume that the population of the United States is 323 million and that the population is reduced 0.15 percent annually. Write an application that displays the populations for the two countries every year until the population of Mexico exceeds that of the United States, and display the number of years it took. Save the file as Population.java.

The Huntington High School basketball team has five players named Art, Bob, Cal, Dan, and Eli. Accept the number of points scored by each player in a game and create a bar chart that illustrates the points scored by displaying an asterisk for each point. The output looks similar to the chart in Figure 6-34. Save the file as BarChart.java.

6-14
--
Modify the BarChart program to accept the number of points scored by each player in a season. The bar chart displays one asterisk for each 10 points scored by a player. For example, if a player has scored 48 points, then display four asterisks. Save the program as BarChart2.java.

6-15
--
A. Create a class named Purchase. Each Purchase contains an invoice number, amount of sale, and amount of sales tax. Include set methods for the invoice number and sale amount. Within the set() method for the sale amount, calculate the sales tax as 5% of the sale amount. Also include a display method that displays a purchase’s details. Save the file as Purchase.java.

B. Create an application that declares a Purchase object and prompts the user for purchase details. When you prompt for an invoice number, do not let the user proceed until a number between 1,000 and 8,000 has been entered. When you prompt for a sale amount, do not proceed until the user has entered a nonnegative value. After a valid Purchase object has been created, display the object’s invoice number, sale amount, and sales tax. Save the file as CreatePurchase.java.
